## Current Data Implementation
The component currently uses dummy data defined in the script:
- Venues array with 5 sample venues
- Categories array with 5 sport types
- Facilities array with 7 facility types

## Recommendations
1. Implement real-time availability tracking
2. Add operating hours and booking schedule
3. Include multiple venue images
4. Add review/rating system
5. Implement geolocation for distance calculation
6. Add venue amenities details
7. Include venue rules/policies
8. Add pricing variations (peak/off-peak)
9. Include venue owner/manager contact details
10. Add booking history tracking

## Security Considerations
1. Implement rate limiting for search/filter API
2. Validate and sanitize all user inputs
3. Use proper authorization for favorite actions
4. Implement CSRF protection
5. Secure sensitive venue data
6. Add API request throttling
7. Implement proper error handling
8. Use secure image upload/storage
9. Add audit logging for changes
10. Implement data backup strategy
